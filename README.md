# Projeto-Space-Cream 

Another project completed, the same as the mobile-first one, however, with full responsiveness. I trained responsiveness once more, applying @media to adapt the project to desktop and others. Animation, transform, transition, colors in HSL, Variables and Clamp to adjust the texts, making the responsiveness even better.

- HSL variables and colors in CSS.

- Setting maximum width and aligning content.

- Fitting the image and overlaying the text.

- Transitions and transformations.

- Animations with CSS.

- Desktop version with CSS Grid.

- Fitting texts with CSS Clamp.

- Adding filters to images with CSS.

- Mobile first

- Responsividade
